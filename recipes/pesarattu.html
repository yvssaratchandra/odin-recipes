<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Pesarattu is a dosa made with Pesara Pappu (moong dal). You use the moong dal with skin on and this is what gives
  this dosa the classic green color. Of course this dosa is high in protein and fiber. Serve it with upma rolled
  inside and it becomes an 'MLA pesarattu'. This is a heavy lentil batter and does not keep very well. Use up the
  batter within 2 days.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>¼ cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoons skin-on, whole green lentils (sabut moong dal)</li>
  <li>2 ½ tablespoons and ½ teaspoon uncooked white rice</li>
  <li>.83 green chile peppers</li>
  <li>.17 (1/2 inch) piece fresh ginger root, peeled</li>
  <li>½ teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
  <li>salt to taste</li>
  <li>cooking spray</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon chopped onion</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Place the lentils and rice into a large container and cover with several inches of cool water; let stand 4 hours
    to overnight.
  </li>

  <li>Blend the lentils, rice, green chile peppers, and ginger together into a smooth paste using a blender or food
    processor. Stir the cumin seed and salt into the paste.
  </li>

  <li>Prepare a flat griddle (tawa) or large, flat-bottomed skillet and place over medium-low heat. Ladle the lentil
    batter onto the middle of the heated surface and spread into a thin circle using the back of the ladle. Sprinkle
    with 1 tablespoon of onions and press the onions onto the pesarattu using your ladle or spatula. Cook for a few
    minutes and flip over to the other side. Cook a few more minutes, transfer to a plate and serve immediately.
    Dosas are best eaten hot and crispy right off the tawa.
